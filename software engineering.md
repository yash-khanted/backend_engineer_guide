Software is a collection of data, special artifacts and procedures (methods)

Software engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantfiable approach to the design, development operation and maintenance of software. An established use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain an economical software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines

Software crisis:
1. software fails to meet the user requirements
2. software crashes frequently
3. development of software is expensive
4. Difficult to alter, debug and enhance the software
5. software was often delivered late
6. software used resources non-optimally

SDLC (SOftware development lifecycle)
- Feasability/ Planning
- Requirement analysis
- Design
  - Means transforming the customer requirements into a set of documents that is suitable for implementation phase. Focus is on defining architecture, module dependencies and various other hardware features.
  - Some artefacts are
    - Functional hierarchy diagram
    - Screen layout diagram
    - Normalized tables
    - Business process diagrams
    - Pseuo code
  - Create a high level and low level design
- Implementation
- Testing
  - The process of executing the program with the intent of finding errors.
  - Level of testing
    - Unit testing
    - Integration testing
    - System testing
    - Acceptance testing
  - Testing a procedural process with three steps
    - Verification
    - validation
    - Defect
- Deployment + maintenance


SDLC Models
1. Waterfall model
2. V model
3. Prototype model
4. Rapid application development
5. Incremental model
6. spiral model
7. ETVx model
