# Discrete Mathematics
**Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete in the sense that they assume only distinct, separate values, rather than in a range of values.** 

It deals with the mathematical objects that are widely used in all most all fields of computer science, such as programming languages, data structures and algorithms, cryptography, operating systems, compilers, computer networks, artificial intelligence, image processing, computer vision, natural language processing, etc. The subject enables the students to formulate problems precisely, solve the problems, apply formal proof techniques and explain their reasoning clearly.

## Mathematical Reasoning
**Logic is Science of reasoning**
## Modular Arithemetic
The branch of mathematics dealing with mod(%) operations on numbers.
### Modular Addiition/Subraction
$(A + B) \% M = ((A \% M) + (B \% M)) \% M$

### Modular Multiplication
$(A * B) \% M = ((A \% M) * (B \% M)) \% M$

### inverse modulo
If $(a * b) \% m = 1$ then b is called inverse modulo of a.

$( b<sup>-1</sup> ) \% m will exist only if gcd(b, m) = 1$


### Modular Exponentiation
$A <sup>B</sup> \% M = {1 -> if n = 0 ((A<sup>B/2</sup>) * (A<sup>B/2</sup>)) \% M -> if n is even
}$

#### Fermat's little theorem
This theorem states that if p is a prime number then $A<sup>(p-1)</sup> \% P = 1$
