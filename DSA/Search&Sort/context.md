# Sorting
The process of organising data in fashion

## Merge Sorting
Here, sorting is done by merging two sorted arrays in recursive manner.
Solution approach\
First, you have to create a program to merge two sorted arrays.
Second, Write a recursive code to divide a single array into two arrays. Till you can one single element that can returned as it is

# Searching

## Binary Search
In this algorithm, an ordered search space must be used. The mechanism is to halve the search space with every iteration based on some condition. Three important things for applying binary search algorithm are
- target - the element that we need to search
- search space - the range
- condition - the decision point which helps in halving the search space
