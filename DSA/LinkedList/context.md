# Linked List
## Motivation
In arrays, the major problem is that the compiler assigns a block of memory for usage before the array elements are passed. This causes MemoryOutOfBoundsIssue, which can be avoided by using a linked list. Here data is stored in different memory location and are somehow connected to each other in order.
## Design
The below code shows the design of linked list.
```java
```
## Flavours
1. Singly linked list
2. Doubly linked list
3. Circular linked list

## Floyd cycle
When a linked list  does not end and creates a cycle in middle somewhere. We use slow and fast pointer concept to find the start of the cycle.
